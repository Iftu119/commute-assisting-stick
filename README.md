# Commute Assisting Stick for Physically Challenged People
## Project for EEE-222 (Academic Course)



The objective of this project is to assist the physically challenged people specially the people with visual impairment and deafness in their daily commute by helping them detecting:

1. Obstacles and the distance of the obstruction.
2. Clogged water in front.
3. Fire in front

While walking, blind people will be able to understand if
there is any obstacle. The frequency of beep will
indicate the distance of the obstacle; the higher the beep
frequency, the closer the obstacle is. If there is any
clogged water in front getting in contact with the stick,
the user will be alerted instantly. In case of fire in front
of the user, the sensor will detect it and let the user know.
